        is provided by

      <h2>2. Scope of This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy applies to information we process about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shopify merchants who install or use the app; and</li>
        <li>Data from the merchant’s Shopify store that our app accesses
            or processes on their behalf.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We act as a <strong>data processor/service provider</strong> for the
        data we handle on behalf of merchants, and as a 
        <strong> data controller/business</strong> for information we collect
        directly about merchants (for example, billing information or
        support communications).
      </p>

      <h2>3. How Do We Collect Information From You?</h2>
      <p>
        Softerra collects information from you when you send it to us directly by filling out 
        forms on our website (including any application you may make for products or services), 
        corresponding with us by e-mail, live chat, or speaking to us by telephone. We also 
        collect information when you install and use ScrollSky in your Shopify store, as set 
        out in detail below. Some of the methods we use to collect data are automated and will 
        take effect automatically as you navigate our website and/or use our services.
      </p>

      <h2>4. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        Personal data relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data. 
        Identification can be by the data alone or in conjunction with any other data in our 
        possession or likely to come into such possession. The processing of your personal data 
        is governed by applicable privacy laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you place an order, register for a new account, or install ScrollSky on your 
        Shopify store, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, e-mail address, 
        mailing address, phone number, or credit card information.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Information from Your Shopify Store</h3>
      <p>
        When you install ScrollSky, Shopify automatically provides us with access to certain 
        types of data from your store via the Shopify API. The actual data we access depends on 
        the permissions you approve during installation. This may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Store information</strong> – store name, URL, email address, time zone, 
          currency, plan type.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Merchant contact details</strong> – name, email address, phone number, 
          billing address.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer data</strong> (if required by the app's features) – customer names, 
          email addresses, shipping/billing addresses, and purchase history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theme or content data</strong> – theme identifiers and configuration we need 
          in order to render widgets or scripts in your store.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.3 Payment Information</h3>
      <p>
        When you add your financial account information to your account, that information is 
        directed to our third-party payment processor. We do not store your financial account 
        information on our systems. All payment transactions are processed through secure 
        payment gateways that comply with PCI DSS standards.
      </p>

      <h3>4.4 User Communications</h3>
      <p>
        If you contact us via email or through our live chat facility, we may receive additional 
        information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of 
        the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose 
        to provide.
      </p>

      <h3>4.5 Non-Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association 
        with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal 
        information for any purpose. General information is collected when you access our 
        website. We use your IP address to identify your location/country when you use our 
        website. We also record information such as the pages you visit most, the time you 
        spend on our website, the number of visits you make, and if you are referred from any 
        other websites or links.
      </p>

      <h3>4.6 Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        We may receive information about you from third-party services, including Shopify, 
        payment processors, and analytics providers, in accordance with their privacy policies 
        and our agreements with them.
      </p>

      <h2>6. What Is Our Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Data?</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the lawful bases for us to process your personal data for the various types 
        of processing performed on your data (please refer to "How Do We Use and Store Your Data?" 
        section of this Policy) is, as applicable, processing based on your consent, as necessary 
        for us to enter into and to perform our contract with you, to comply with our obligations 
        under the applicable employment, social security or social protection laws, or as necessary 
        to pursue the legitimate interest of our Company or of third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process your 
        personal data under the following legal bases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To perform our contract with you (for example, to provide the app);</li>
        <li>To pursue our legitimate interests (such as improving and securing the app), where 
            those interests are not overridden by your rights;</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations; and</li>
        <li>With your consent, where applicable. You may withdraw consent at any time by 
            contacting us.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will collect, process and use the personal information supplied by you only for the 
        purposes communicated to you and will not disclose it to third parties except under the 
        circumstances of data disclosure to third parties in the section "How Do We Disclose Your 
        Information?" below.
      </p>

      <h2>7. How Do We Disclose Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, Softerra does not share your Personal 
        Information with unaffiliated third parties other than as set out in this Privacy Policy. 
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We will never disclose your 
        Personal Information to an unaffiliated third party for the purposes of e-mail or other 
        marketing unless we first obtain your consent to do so.
      </p>
      <p>We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> – with trusted third-party vendors who help us 
          operate the app (for example: hosting, data storage, analytics, customer support). 
          These providers are bound by contractual obligations to protect your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shopify</strong> – as necessary to provide the app and comply with Shopify's 
          requirements and policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business transfers</strong> – In the event that Softerra is purchased by 
          another company, merges with another company or has a substantial portion of its assets 
          purchased by another company, we may share your Personal Information with that company. 
          In such an event, we will notify you in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and safety</strong> – We may also share information to (i) satisfy any 
          applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce this 
          Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations 
          hereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; 
          (iv) respond to your requests; or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users 
          and the public. This includes exchanging information with other companies and 
          organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Softerra limits the use of Personal Information to the purposes identified in this 
        Privacy Policy and for which you have provided explicit consent. In accordance with 
        established policies and procedures, we retain Personal Information only for as long as 
        necessary to fulfil the stated purposes, unless it is required by law for a different 
        period or we have the consent of the individual.
      </p>
      <p>In general:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Store and app configuration data are retained while the app is installed and for a 
          reasonable period afterward.
        </li>
        <li>
          Log and analytics data may be retained for a limited period for security, 
          troubleshooting, and reporting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transactional and billing information may be retained as required by law for tax and 
          accounting purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you uninstall the app, we will remove or anonymize personal data that we no longer 
        need, subject to any legal retention requirements. In accordance with established policies 
        and procedures, we will periodically destroy or erase any Personal Information that is no 
        longer needed.
      </p>

      <h2>9. How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
      <p>
        We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal 
        information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. 
        We protect your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized 
        access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and 
        data access authorization controls. We take our data security very seriously. Therefore, 
        the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to 
        provide effective protection against abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied information is transmitted via Secure 
        Socket Layer (SSL) technology using best-practice encryption techniques. Transactional 
        information such as payment details are encrypted before they are processed by our Payment 
        gateway provider only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to 
        such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 
        100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Use of Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that 
        we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may use session cookies

      </p>
      <p>
        You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. A session ID cookie expires 
        when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended 
        period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following the instructions provided 
        in your internet browser. If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your 
        individual browser options. More detailed information about cookie management with specific 
        web browsers can be found at the browsers' respective websites.

      <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        We may process and store information in countries other than the country where you are 
        located. Where required by law, we implement appropriate safeguards (such as standard 
        contractual clauses) to ensure that any transferred personal data remains protected.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        Based on what you have told us, we will try to ensure that your contact information and 
        preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date. You have the right to request access 
        to and rectification or erasure of Personal Information or restriction of processing 
        concerning your Personal Information or to object to processing as well as the right to 
        data portability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will comply with erasure requests as long as we are not required to retain the Personal 
        Information by law and do not need to retain it for our legitimate business purposes. We 
        may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardise the privacy of 
        others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local 
        law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by emailing us using the contact 
        information provided in the Contact Us section below.
